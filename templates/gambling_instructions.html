        </header>

        <main class="instructions-content panel">
            <p>We would like you to remember the details of your gambling over the past 3 months. We don't
            ask you to do this to make you feel ashamed or guilty about your gambling. We aren't trying to
            keep you stuck rehashing events you wish to move past. We ask you to review your gambling
            like this because we find that this information will help us learn about your gambling in a level
            of detail that allows us to work together to really empower you to make lasting changes.</p>

            <p>Completing this may feel like a challenging task. But there are some strategies to help you
            remember. Many people find their gambling behavior follows a predictable pattern, making it
            less difficult to complete this assignment as they had imagined. We have found that the calendars
            we give you are very useful in helping people remember their gambling activity.</p>

            <p><strong>Please read the full instructions and tips below before completing the calendar.</strong></p>

            <h2>Gambling Calendar</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Every day on the calendar needs to be completed.</li>
                <li>On those days that you did not gamble at all, mark a "0" or an "X" in that day's box.</li>
                <li>For each day that you gambled, please give the following information:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>The type of Gambling you did.</strong>
                            <p class="instructions-example">EXAMPLE: slot machines, poker, roulette, horse track, sports, lottery</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>The amount of Time spent gambling.</strong>
                            <p class="instructions-note">NOTE: This item asks how long did you gamble for on this occasion? If you are someone
                            who sports bets, you may find it more helpful to list the amount of time you spend
                            researching and strategizing bets in addition to the minutes it takes to place the bets to better
                            capture the impact of your behavior on your day. Put your answers in hours. If you gambled
                            for one hour and a half you would write 1.5</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>The amount of money you Intend (wanted) to wager.</strong>
                            <p class="instructions-note">NOTE: This means, how much money did you plan to bet during the gambling session. Did you
                            set a limit for how much you would wager? For example, if you went to the casino thinking that
                            you would only gamble $100, then you would write $100 on the calendar. If you only intended to
                            gamble with free play or money from an incentive, please list the amount you intended to spend
                            and put a * next to the amount of free play. If for example you intended to bet $40 of free play
                            and $40 your own money you would write $40*/$40 for that day.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>The amount of money Risked.</strong>
                            <p class="instructions-note">NOTE: This means, the total amount of money that wasn't money you won that you gambled
                            with during the gambling session. This means take the dollar amount you walked in with in
                            your pocket or that was available funds within your account/ through free play/ incentives
                            and add it to any money withdrawn from an ATM or credit card, any money that you
                            borrowed (from friends, family, or the casino) that you put into play. For example if you
                            walked into a casino with $100 and then borrowed $200 from a friend, you would write $300
                            on the calendar for the amount risked. If you had $300 available in credits in your online
                            gambling account, spent that and then added an additional $200 to the account you would
                            write $500.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>The amount of money Won or Lost.</strong>
                            <p class="instructions-note">NOTE: This means the amount of total winnings or losses at the end of the gambling session.
                            Therefore, if you began an evening of gambling with $100 and ended up with $150 when you
                            finished, then you would write +$50 for that day. However, if you ended up with only $75 at
                            the end of the same gambling session you would write -$25 for that day.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Did you drink any alcoholic Drinks while gambling.</strong>
                            <p class="instructions-note">If you consumed any alcohol drinks with gambling please write yes. If you did not drink at all
                            please write no.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Helpful Hints</h2>
            <p>It may be useful to remember specific times when:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>You didn't gamble for long periods of time.</li>
                <li>You gambled in a very regular, scheduled, or consistent way.
                    <p class="instructions-example">For example, during January you played poker with friends every Tuesday night.</p>
                </li>
                <li>It is helpful to mark on the calendar days that are special such as birthdays, paydays, anniversary, etc.</li>
                <li>To think about the typical amount and way you gamble and the day/days you gambled the
                most. If there ends up being a day you know you gambled but aren't sure how much, it's
                probably going to have been less than your maximum day and somewhere close to your average.</li>
                <li>It may be helpful to use your financial records or to look back at your online accounts to
                see records of money spent and wins/losses. Some people find reviewing social media
                posts or the pictures they have saved on their phone can serve as a record of wins,
                vacations, or other life events that might correspond to gambling or not gambling.</li>
