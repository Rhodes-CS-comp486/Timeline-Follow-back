            <h1>Timeline Followback Instructions for Alcohol Use</h1>
        </header>

        <main class="instructions-content panel">
            <p>To get an idea of what your alcohol use was like in the last past days, we would like you to fill out
            the attached calendar.</p>

            <h2>What to Fill In</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>When you did drink, you would write in the total number of standard drinks you had on that day.</li>
                <li>When you did not drink, uncheck "Did you drink alcohol today?" and a red X will appear on that day's box on the calendar. You still need to submit the entry even if you did not drink that day.</li>
                <li><strong>THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO WRITE SOMETHING IN ON EACH DAY, EVEN IF IT IS A "0."</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>We Want You to Record Your Drinking Using Standard Drinks</h2>

            <p>To help you, we want you to use a Standard Drink conversion:</p>

            <p><strong>1 Standard Drink =</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>One 12 oz. beer (5%)</li>
                <li>One 5 oz. glass of wine (11&ndash;12%)</li>
                <li>1&frac12; oz. of hard liquor or spirits straight (40%)</li>
                <li>1&frac12; oz. of hard liquor or spirits in a mixed drink (40%)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p class="instructions-example">If you had six 12-oz. beers, write 6 in for that day.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="instructions-example">If you drank more than one kind of alcoholic beverage in a day, such as two 12-oz. beers and three
                    5-oz. glasses of wine, you would write 5 in for that day.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="instructions-note">Holidays are marked on the calendar to help you recall your drinking. You can also think about how
                    much you drank on personal holidays and events such as birthdays, vacations, and parties.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Your Best Estimate</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Filling out the calendar is not hard!</li>
                <li>If you are not sure whether you drank three or six drinks or whether you drank on a Thursday or a
                Friday, give it your best estimate.</li>
                <li>We recognize people will not have perfect recall, just try to be as accurate as possible.</li>
            </ul>
